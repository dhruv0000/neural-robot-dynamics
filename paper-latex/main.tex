% \begin{abstract}
% Simulating modern robots accurately and efficiently is an open challenge. Classical simulators either fail to capture complex dynamics, resulting in a significant sim-to-real gap, or are computationally inefficient, making methods such as online reinforcement learning intractable.
% Neural simulators have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex dynamics from ground-truth data; however, the learned models often do not generalize to unseen tasks and environments.
% In this work, we develop a framework for learning generalizable neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. Concretely, we present \textit{NeRD} (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models that replace the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in a classical rigid-body simulator, predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints.
% At the core of our approach are (1) a robot-centric abstract contact representation to enhance generalizability across tasks and environments, (2) a spatially-invariant state parameterization to improve the spatial generalizability of the neural dynamics models, and (3) a set of thoroughly-evaluated design decisions that enable the approach to succeed. 
% The resulting neural robot dynamics are stable, accurate, and efficient over hundreds of simulation steps; generalize to different tasks and environment configurations; support customized robotic controllers; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be easily fine-tuned from real-world data.
% We integrate the learned neural robot dynamics models within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator, and we validate our approach by conducting extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world to showcase the long-horizon stability, generalizability, and real-world fine-tunability of the models.

% Simulating modern robots accurately and efficiently remains challenging due to the increasing complexity of robot mechanisms.
Neural simulators have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators, capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world data; however, existing neural simulators typically require application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.

In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We propose \textit{NeRD} (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints. \textit{NeRD} uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation. We integrate the learned \textit{NeRD} models as an interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the \textit{NeRD} simulators are stable and accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.
